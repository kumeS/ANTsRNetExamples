# To do:

* deconvnet.R
* ResNet and AlexNet use lambda layers so those models aren't writeable to file (h5 format).  So we need to redo to rewrite to json or something else.  At least I think that's the problem. 
* Need to go through and make sure that the 'tf' vs. 'th' ordering is accounted for.  Currently, tensorflow is assumed.  Should work with theano but need to check this.
